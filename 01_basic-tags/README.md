## 💡 Key Takeaways

- HTML is the **skeleton** of all web pages.
- The structure always starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>` followed by `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Headings define **hierarchy and structure** — use `<h1>` only once per page!
- `<br>` is for line breaks, `<hr>` is for thematic breaks.
- Comments help you annotate code without affecting the output.

## ✅ Quick Practice
