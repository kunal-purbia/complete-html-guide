# 🏷️ Chapter 7: Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML introduces meaning to your content structure by using elements that describe their purpose clearly. This improves **accessibility, SEO, and maintainability**.

Rather than using generic `<div>` or `<span>` tags everywhere, semantic tags tell the browser and developers what kind of content is being represented.

## 🧠 Why Semantic HTML?

- Enhances accessibility for screen readers
- Improves search engine indexing
- Makes your code more readable and maintainable

## 🧱 Semantic Tags You’ll Learn

- `<header>` – Top section of a page or section
- `<nav>` – Navigation links
- `<main>` – Main content of the document
- `<section>` – Group of related content
- `<article>` – Standalone content (like a blog post)
- `<aside>` – Sidebar or supplementary info
- `<footer>` – Footer section
- `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` – Images with captions
- `<mark>`, `<time>`, `<summary>`, `<details>` – For special semantic needs

|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `01_basic-semantics.html`   | Demonstrates the use of basic semantic tags     |
| `02_article-section.html`   | Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` |
| `03_layout-example.html`    | Full-page layout using semantic elements        |

## 💡 Best Practices

- Use semantic elements instead of nested `<div>` blocks.
- Combine semantic tags with ARIA roles for more accessible experiences.
- Structure content hierarchically for better flow and readability.

## ✅ Practice Task

Build a simple blog layout that includes:
- A `<header>` with the blog title and nav links
- A `<main>` with multiple `<article>` elements for posts
- An `<aside>` for recent posts or tags
- A `<footer>` with copyright
